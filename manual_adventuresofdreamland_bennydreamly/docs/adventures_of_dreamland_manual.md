# Adventures of Dreamland Manual

## What is this?

This is a manual for the game [Adventures of Dreamland](https://github.com/benny-dreamly/adventures-of-dreamland), which is an adventure game that I made myself for a
class project in Python based on the boilerplate template provided by the teacher. It's a fairly unique experience in terms of story, and you should definitely play it before
trying the manual, as this **will** require some knowledge from at least one complete run of the game from start to finish.

## What are the checks?

Item pickups and certain actions and things are the checks in this manual, and the items you pickup are items you can received from the multiworld.
